1. Double quotes "" can parse the variable but single quotes '' cannot.
	For example- $ Myvar=99
		     $ echo "Myvar"
		     O/P
		     99
		But
		     $ Myvar=99
	     	     $ echo 'Myvar'
		     O/P
		     Myvar
This is a important difference between "" and ''.





2. unset command is used to unset a variable or remove the variable.
	for example $ Myvar=90
		    $ echo $Myvar
		    O/P
		    90
			
		    $ unset Myvar
		    $ echo Myvar
		    O/P
		    

The o/p is nothing as the Myvar is unset and has no value anymore.

3. Important: What is environment in linux and what is inheriting environment, how it can be done?

4. export command: this command assigns values to the variables to its present shell and to the child shell of the present shell.
		
	For example: $ export myvar=90
		     $ echo $myvar
			o/p
		     $ 90
		     $ bash
		--new child of bash--
		     $ echo $myvar
		     $ 90
		     $ exit
		-- exiting from the child shell--
		
	# one more important thing is that export only assigns value only for the current shell and its child shell but not for the parent shell.
